Compiling FlashForth 3.7
------------------------

FlashForth 3.7 (FF) can be compiled
with the USB library and without.

FF may also be compiled for installation via
a device programmer (PicKit2) or a bootloader.
The bootloadable FF has been tested with the
PICDEM FS USB Demo tool bootloader available from MicroChip.

For operation with the UART as the OPERATOR interface,
define a MPLAB project which compiles ff18_37_usb.asm.
Undefine USB_CDC in the configuration file.
If you use a device programmer, use the FF37_0000.lkr file 
and define CONFIG_RESET 0x0000 in ff18_37_usb.asm.
If you use a bootloader, use the FF37_0800.lkr file 
and define CONFIG_RESET 0x0800 in ff18_37_usb.asm.

For operation with the USB CDC serial emulation as the OPERATOR
interface, define a MPLAB project which compiles
ff18_37_usb.asm and P18F2455.asm and links FF37_USB.lib
Define USB_CDC in the configuration file.
If you use a device programmer, use the FF37_USB_0000.lkr file 
and define CONFIG_RESET 0x0000 in ff18_37_usb.asm.
If you use a bootloader, use the FF37_USB_0800.lkr file 
and define CONFIG_RESET 0x0800 in ff18_37_usb.asm.
The FF37_USB.lib requires that the processor type is set to 18f2455.
The HEX file will still work also on 18f4455 18f2550 and 18f4550

The result of the compilation is a HEX file which can then be moved
to the target processor, either via a device programmer or a bootloader.

NOTE :
The USB VID and PID and the INF file provided with FlashForth
are purely for test purposes and for personal use.
